            <p>basketcase333 is the moniker of 26 year old artist and producer Matthew Jacobs </p>  


                <p>Matthew’s musical journey began at the age of 8 with classical and pop piano lessons, which helped shape his love for music at an early age.  In the summer before 7th grade, he met his friend Daniel at a birthday party who introduced him to the world of electronic music and DJing.  It was a pivotal moment for him, and expanded his perception of what music could be.</p>
                
                <p>From there, Matthew dove headfirst into DJing, livestreaming sets, playing for friends, and taking any opportunity he could to perform.  His passion for DJing eventually sparked the desire to start creating his own tracks, wanting to mix them alongside his favorite artists’ songs in his sets.  After getting his hands on a copy of Ableton, he never looked back.</p>
                
            
                <p>Since then, Matthew graduated from Icon Collective with a diploma in music production and sound design.  He spent three years living in LA, collaborating with artists and friends. While there, he also interned with Tyler Bates of Alice in Chains fame.  He resides in Boston, where he is continuing his studies at Berklee College of Music.</p>
